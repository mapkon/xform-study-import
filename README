For importing XML that was either exported by openxdata or converted by a tool like the oc-conversion-tools. It extracts a study from the given xml with corresponding child items like forms and versions. The study should be displayable in openxdata.

This library is meant to be used as a dependency in the openxdata API. The API should pass the XML to the library and expect a valid StudyDef to be returned for saving.

For setup:
 * Navigate to root folder
 * Run mvn eclipse:eclipse
 * Import into eclipse IDE

Enjoy!
